# Threat Model

Baseline Integrity is designed to **reduce cheat effectiveness**, not to provide absolute prevention.

## In Scope
- Client-side manipulation that creates statistically detectable advantages
- Automation and assistive tooling that alters player outcomes
- Replayable or scalable cheat techniques
- Integrity degradation over multiple matches

## Out of Scope (by design)
- Physical capture devices (e.g. DMA cards)
- Human-assisted cheating (paid boosting, account sharing)
- One-off exploits without repetition
- Nation-state adversaries

## Assumptions
- Game servers remain authoritative
- Match outcomes are observable and aggregate-able
- Cheating seeks advantage, not novelty
- Attackers adapt over time

Baseline Integrity focuses on **cost escalation**, **risk accumulation**, and **delayed feedback**, rather than instant detection.
